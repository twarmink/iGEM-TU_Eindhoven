# TU_Eindhoven
The repository for all the code created by team iGEM TU Eindhoven 2021.

This repository contains a model of the sensing system in combination with the expression of GFP, and a model of the sensing system in combination with the expression of ARG1. To view the models, MATLAB needs to be used in combination with the add-on SimBiology. 

In addition, a MATLAB script is provided for the image processing of the ultrasound images. The reconstruction framework that was used for the images can be accessed through the PULS/e gitlab via this link upon request: http://mategit.wfw.wtb.tue.nl/PULSe/Pulse_Imaging_Toolbox
